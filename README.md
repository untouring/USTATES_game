Guess the State.

I don't own any rights of The US National Anthem and of the image! All rights goes to it(s)' owner(s). I just use them in my non-commercial little project. You can copy and past or even download my code and/or all my files for non-commercial purposes. You can also edit everything as you like. Just have fun with the project ;)
