# USTATES_game
Guess the State.

I don't own any rights of The US National Anthem and of the image! All rights goes to it(s)' owner(s). I just use them in my non-commercial little project. You can copy and past or even download my code and/or all my files for non-commercial purposes. You can also edit everything as you like.

I decided to comment some of the lines(I wrote a code that creates a .csv file of missed States each time I'd decide to end the game), because I don't want to create external files while runinng my program. If you want to create .csv files, just uncomment these lines. Or you can just delete these lines and look at the terminal every time you finish the game, because all the needed info will be there.

Just have fun with the project ;)
